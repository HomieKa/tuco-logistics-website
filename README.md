# TUCO Logistics Website

Marketing site for TUCO Logistics, built with Vue 3, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The app targets GitHub Pages and uses hash-based routing so every refresh works under `/tuco-logistics/`.

## Stack
- Vue 3 + `<script setup>` single-file components
- Vite tooling with hash history router
- Tailwind CSS design system with custom TUCO tokens
- VueUse Head for lightweight SEO metadata

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- npm 9+

Install dependencies once:

```bash
npm install
```

## Commands
| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the Vite dev server (hash history under `/`). |
| `npm run build` | Type-check with `vue-tsc` then build for production. |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally. |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint against `src/**/*.ts,vue`. |
| `npm run lint:fix` | Autofix lint issues. |
| `npm run format` | Prettier check for Vue/TS/CSS. |
| `npm run format:fix` | Prettier write mode. |

## Development Notes
- Vite `base` is `/tuco-logistics/`; the router uses `createWebHashHistory(import.meta.env.BASE_URL)` to keep GitHub Pages happy.
- The optional freight tracking proxy runs on `npm run proxy` and forwards `/api/track/*` to the configured upstream (`VITE_TRACK_PROXY_TARGET`).
- Tailwind tokens live in `tailwind.config.js`; global styles are in `src/assets/styles/main.css`.

## Deployment
Automated GitHub Actions builds (see `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) publish the `dist/` bundle to the `gh-pages` branch and copy `index.html` to `404.html` for SPA fallback. Manual steps and Pages settings live in `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
